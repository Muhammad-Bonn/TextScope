This repository combines two AI-powered NLP projects focused on understanding and classifying text:

    Definition Analyzer – Uses natural language processing to analyze word definitions (e.g., “love”) and extract meaning or emotional context.

    Content Classifier – Automatically classifies YouTube episode descriptions into scientific or thematic categories (e.g., Psychology, Economics, History).

These tools aim to explore the intersection of language, meaning, and intelligent classification using modern machine learning techniques.
